# üìö Key Takeaways from LeetCode 3459: Longest V-Shaped Diagonal Segment

> This document summarizes the solution to LeetCode problem 3459, focusing on the core algorithm and its clever optimizations.  The problem involves finding the longest path in a grid following a specific "V-shaped" diagonal pattern, which is efficiently solved using Depth-First Search (DFS) with memoization.

## üß† Core Concepts üí°

### üéØ Problem Deconstruction

*   **V-Shaped Diagonal Segment:** A path starting at `1`, alternating between `2` and `0`, moving diagonally, with at most one 90-degree clockwise turn.
*   **Goal:** Find the absolute longest such path in the grid.
*   **Constraints:** Path must start with `1`, alternate `2` and `0`, and can only make one turn.


## üí° Algorithm & Approach ü§î

*   **Pathfinding:** The problem is a grid-based pathfinding challenge.
*   **Depth-First Search (DFS):**  A recursive DFS is the natural approach to explore all possible paths.
*   **Memoization (Dynamic Programming):** To avoid redundant calculations, memoization stores the results of DFS calls for previously explored states.
*   **Overall Strategy:**
    *   Iterate through the grid to find all starting points (`1`).
    *   For each starting point, launch a DFS in all four diagonal directions.
    *   DFS explores paths, tracking current position, direction, and turns.
    *   Memoization optimizes the DFS.
    *   Track the maximum path length found.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Details & Code Analysis ‚öôÔ∏è

### üó∫Ô∏è `DIRS` Tuple:  A Clever Trick

*   `DIRS = ((-1, 1), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, -1))`
*   Represents diagonal directions (Top-Right, Bottom-Right, Bottom-Left, Top-Left).
*   **Elegant Turn Handling:**  A clockwise turn is simply moving to the next index in `DIRS` (wrapping around).  `nextDir = (dir + 1) % 4`


### üî¨ `dfs` Function: The Recursive Heart

*   `dfs(i, j, turned, num, dir)`
    *   `(i, j)`: Current coordinates.
    *   `turned`: Boolean indicating if a turn has been made (0 or 1).
    *   `num`: Expected value (`2` or `0`) at `(i, j)`.
    *   `dir`: Current direction (index from `DIRS`).
*   **Logic:**
    *   **Base Cases:** Returns `0` if out of bounds or the expected number is not found.
    *   **Recursive Steps:**
        *   Extends path by 1 if valid.
        *   Recursively calls itself:
            *   Going straight (`dir`).
            *   Turning (if `turned` is False), using `(dir + 1) % 4` and setting `turned` to True.
*   **Memoization (Implicit):**  The solution likely uses memoization (not explicitly shown in the provided snippet) to store results based on the state parameters (`i`, `j`, `turned`, `num`, `dir`).


‚úÖ **Action Items:**

*   Review the complete Python code to understand the implementation of memoization.
*   Analyze the time and space complexity of the algorithm.
*   Consider alternative approaches to solving this problem, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS).
