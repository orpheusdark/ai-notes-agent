📚 **Key Takeaways from Unit I: Introduction to Algorithms and Programming Languages**

# Introduction to Algorithms 💡

Algorithms are a set of rules or instructions that define how a task is executed to achieve a desired outcome.

## Key Features of Algorithms 🔑

*   **Clear and Unambiguous:** Each step is clear and has only one meaning.
*   **Well-Defined Inputs:**  Clearly specifies the required inputs.
*   **Well-Defined Outputs:** Clearly defines the expected output.
*   **Finite-ness:**  The algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.
*   **Feasible:** The algorithm is practical and can be executed with available resources.
*   **Language Independent:** The instructions can be implemented in any programming language.


## Advantages of Algorithms 👍

*   Easy to understand.
*   Step-wise representation of a solution.
*   Simplifies problem solving by breaking it into smaller steps.

## Disadvantages of Algorithms 👎

*   Time-consuming to write.
*   Branching and looping statements can be difficult to represent.


## Example Algorithm: Sum of Three Numbers ➕

1.  **START**
2.  Declare three integer variables: `num1`, `num2`, `num3`.
3.  Input three numbers into `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`.
4.  Declare an integer variable `sum`.
5.  Calculate `sum = num1 + num2 + num3`.
6.  Print the value of `sum`.
7.  **END**


# Flowcharts 📊

A flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm using symbols to show the flow of information and processing.

## Common Flowchart Symbols 🔶

*   **Rectangle:** Process
*   **Oval:** Start/End
*   **Diamond:** Decision
*   **Parallelogram:** Input/Output


# Algorithms vs. Flowcharts ⚖️

|------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Step-by-step procedure                  | Diagram showing data flow                       |
| 2    | Complex to understand                     | Easy to understand                              |
| 3    | Uses plain text                           | Uses symbols/shapes                             |
| 4    | Easy to debug                             | Hard to debug                                  |
| 5    | Difficult to construct                    | Simple to construct                             |
| 6    | Does not follow strict construction rules | Follows specific construction rules              |
| 7    | Pseudocode for a program                | Graphical representation of program logic       |


# Pseudocode 📝

Pseudocode is an informal, artificial language used to develop algorithms. It's a text-based design tool that describes the program flow.  Pseudocode is the basis for algorithms, which form the foundation of programming languages.


## Pseudocode vs. Algorithms 📝 vs. 💡

The main difference is that pseudocode describes the program flow, while an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.  Pseudocode is a higher-level description than an algorithm.


# Programming Languages 💻

Programming languages are used to give instructions to a computer system.

*   **Low-level languages:** Directly access processor features.
*   **High-level languages:**  More abstract and easier for humans to understand.


✅ **Action Items:**

*   Practice designing algorithms for different problems.
*   Learn to create flowcharts for various scenarios.
*   Explore different pseudocode examples.
*   Research low-level and high-level programming languages.
