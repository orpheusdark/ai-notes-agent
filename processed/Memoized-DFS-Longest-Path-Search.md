# 📚 Key Takeaways from Longest Path in a Grid

> This document summarizes the solution to finding the longest path in a grid containing 1s and 0s.  The core approach uses Depth-First Search (DFS) with memoization to dramatically improve efficiency, avoiding exponential time complexity. The algorithm efficiently explores all possible paths from each '1' cell, and the memoization cache ensures that each subproblem is solved only once.

## 🧠 Core Concepts 💡

### Memoization: The Efficiency Boost 🚀

*   The `@functools.lru_cache(None)` decorator is crucial for performance.
*   **Without Memoization:** Exponential time complexity due to repeated calculations.  The algorithm would time out on larger grids.
*   **With Memoization:** Each subproblem (`i`, `j`, `turned`, `num`, `dir`) is solved only once. Subsequent calls are instant lookups.  This significantly reduces time complexity.

### The Main Loop: Kicking off the Search 🏁

*   The `return max((1 + dfs(...) for ... if num == 1 for ...), default=0)` statement drives the process:
    *   Iterates through each cell (`i`, `j`) in the grid.
    *   If a `1` is found, it initiates a DFS search from that cell in all four diagonal directions (`d`).
    *   Calculates the path length as `1` (starting cell) + the result of the recursive DFS call.
    *   `max(..., default=0)` selects the longest path and handles the case where no `1` exists (returning `0`).

## 📈 Complexity Analysis 📊

*   **Time Complexity:** O(n × m)
    *   Memoization ensures each state (`i`, `j`, `turned`, `num`, `dir`) is computed at most once.
    *   The total number of states is proportional to n × m.

*   **Space Complexity:** O(n × m)
    *   Space is primarily used by the memoization cache and the recursion stack, both proportional to the number of grid cells.


✅ **Action Items:**

*   Implement the solution using Python and the `@functools.lru_cache` decorator.
*   Test the solution on various grid sizes to verify performance improvements.
*   Consider alternative optimization techniques if further performance gains are needed for extremely large grids.
