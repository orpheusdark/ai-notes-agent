# 📚 Key Takeaways from Parul University NAAC A+ CECET Civil Services 2025 SADHNA Program Notes

> This document summarizes key concepts and answers from a series of questions covering Earth science, courage, honesty, Indian governance, economics, and mathematics.  The notes highlight core concepts and provide concise answers to multiple-choice questions.

## 🌎 Earth Science 🌍

### Earth's Composition and Features

*   Earth is the only known planet to sustain life.
*   Formed approximately 4.54 billion years ago from cosmic dust and gas.
*   ~75% of its surface is covered by water (oceans regulate global temperature).
*   Layered interior: crust, mantle (semi-solid rock driving tectonic plates), metallic core (generating Earth's magnetic field).
*   Atmosphere (nitrogen & oxygen) filters harmful radiation and moderates temperature.

### Inferences about Earth's Oceans

*   Oceans store more heat than land and redistribute it globally.  This is the most reasonable inference from the provided text.
*   The other options (main source of atmospheric nitrogen, thickest geological layer, preventing volcanic activity) are incorrect based on the passage.


## 💪 Courage and Honesty 🤔

### Developing Courage

*   Courage is often developed through challenging circumstances and training.
*   Training programs in high-risk professions demonstrate that courage is not solely innate.
*   Immediate action, even with risk, often prevents greater harm; hesitation leads to failure.

### The Importance of Honesty

*   Honesty is a vital virtue, though often compromised for convenience.
*   Small lies erode personal character and societal trust.
*   True honesty requires courage and consistency, even in difficult situations.


## 🇮🇳 Indian Governance and Economics 🏛️

### Separation of Powers in India

*   The Indian government employs a separation of powers between the legislature (makes laws), executive (implements laws), and judiciary (interprets laws).
*   Example: Parliament enacts laws; government executes them; courts review their validity.

### Indian Economy Sectors

*   The Indian economy has three sectors:
    *   **Primary Sector:** Agriculture, fishing, forestry, mining (declining GDP share despite high employment).
    *   **Secondary Sector:** Manufacturing (textiles, steel, food processing).
    *   **Tertiary Sector:** Services (trade, transport, banking, education, IT) - largest contributor to GDP.

## 🧮 Mathematics Problems ➕➖✖️➗

### Problem 1: Fraction of a Number

*   If (3/5) of a number is 54, then (1/9) of that number is 18.

### Problem 2: Alarm Clock Intervals

*   Two alarm clocks ringing at intervals of 50 and 48 seconds will beep together again for the first time after 1200 seconds (20 minutes), at 12:20.

### Problem 3: Team Selection

*   There are 105 different ways to select a team of 6 children (at least 2 girls) from 4 girls and 5 boys.

### Problem 4: Zoo Animals

*   There are 10 parrots and 5 tigers in the zoo (15 heads, 50 legs).


## 🎓 Education and Social Life 🧑‍🎓🤝

### The Responsibility of Education

*   Education is a responsibility, not just a privilege.  Neglecting studies wastes resources and is unfair to others.

### The Nature of Social Life

*   Human dependence necessitates social life (families, communities, governments).  The desire to fulfill needs brings people together.



## ✅ Action Items

*   Review the key inferences regarding Earth's oceans and the implications of honesty and courage.
*   Further research the specifics of the Indian political and economic systems.
*   Practice similar mathematical problems to improve problem-solving skills.
