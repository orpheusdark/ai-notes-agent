# 🔭 ExoNova Project: AI/ML for Exoplanet Identification

> This document summarizes the ExoNova project, aiming to develop an AI/ML model for automated exoplanet identification using NASA's open-source datasets from Kepler, K2, and TESS missions.  The project will include a user-friendly web interface allowing data upload, model retraining, and hyperparameter tuning, catering to both researchers and novice users.

## 🧠 Core Concepts 

### 🤔 Project Background
*   Manual exoplanet identification is time-consuming.
*   Missions like Kepler, K2, and TESS provide vast datasets using the *transit method*.
*   AI/ML offers potential for highly accurate automated analysis.
*   Leveraging open-source NASA datasets is key.

### 🎯 Project Objectives
*   **Data Training:** Train the model on NASA's Kepler, K2, and TESS datasets (orbital period, transit duration, planetary radius, etc.).
*   **Automated Identification:** Accurately classify data as confirmed exoplanets, candidates, or false positives.
*   **Web Interface:** Develop a user-friendly interface for data upload, model retraining (potentially), accuracy display, and hyperparameter tuning.
*   **Open-Source Tools:** Utilize open-source programming languages and ML libraries.
*   **Data Variable Impact:** Analyze how each data variable influences classification and optimize accordingly.
*   **Target Audience:**  Researchers and novice users interested in exoplanet data.
