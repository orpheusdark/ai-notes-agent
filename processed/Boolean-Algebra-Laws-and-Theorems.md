## 🧠 Core Concepts of Boolean Algebra 🧮

### 💡 Boolean Variables and Operations

*   Variables: Take only two values: logic 0 and logic 1.
*   Basic Operations:
    *   Complement (NOT):  `¬A` or `A̅`
    *   ORing (addition symbol +): `A + B`
    *   ANDing (dot symbol .): `A . B` or `A B`

### 🧮 Boolean Algebra Laws and Properties 

*   **Commutative Law:** `A.B = B.A`, `A+B = B+A`
*   **Associative Law:** `A.(B.C) = (A.B).C`, `A+(B+C) = (A+B)+C`
*   **Distributive Law:** `A.(B+C) = A.B + A.C`, `A + BC = (A+B)(A+C)`
*   **AND Laws:**
    *   `A.0 = 0`
    *   `A.1 = A`
    *   `A.A = A`
    *   `A.A̅ = 0`
*   **OR Laws:**
    *   `A+0 = A`
    *   `A+1 = 1`
    *   `A+A = A`
    *   `A+A̅ = 1`
*   **Inversion/Complement/NOT Laws:**
    *   `0̅ = 1`
    *   `1̅ = 0`
    *   `(A̅)̅ = A`
*   **Absorption Law:**
    *   `A(A+B) = A`
    *   `A+AB = A`
    *   `A+A̅B = A+B`
*   **De Morgan's Laws:**
    *   First Law:  `(A+B+C...)̅ = A̅.B̅.C̅...`
    *   Second Law: `(A.B.C...)̅ = A̅+B̅+C̅...`
*   **Operator Precedence:** Parenthesis > NOT > AND > OR


### ✍️ Boolean Expressions and Forms

*   **Canonical Form:** Boolean functions expressed as a sum of minterms or product of maxterms.
*   **Minterm:** A product term where all variables appear exactly once (complemented or uncomplemented). Used for Sum of Products (SOP) form (output high states).
*   **Maxterm:** A sum term where all variables appear exactly once (complemented or uncomplemented). Used for Product of Sums (POS) form (output low states).
*   **Standard Forms:** Similar to canonical but not all variables need to appear in each term.


## 🛠️ Minimization Techniques 🔬

### 🗺️ Karnaugh Map (K-Map)

*   A graphical method for simplifying Boolean expressions (2-6 variables).
*   Grouping adjacent 1s (for SOP) or 0s (for POS) in powers of two to eliminate variables.
*   Handles *Don't Care Conditions* ('X' or 'φ').

### 🎯 Prime Implicants and Essential Prime Implicants

*   **Prime Implicants (PI):** Each grouping of adjacent minterms or maxterms.
*   **Essential Prime Implicants (EPI):** PIs that cover at least one minterm/maxterm not covered by any other PI.

### 🧮 Quine-McCluskey Method

*   A more systematic, algorithmic method for minimizing expressions, suitable for a larger number of variables and machine computation.


##  Schaltkreis ⚙️ Combinational Circuits

> Combinational circuits are time-independent circuits; their output depends solely on the present inputs.

### 🧱 Design Procedure

1.  State the problem.
2.  Determine input and output variables.
3.  Assign letter symbols to variables.
4.  Derive the truth table.
5.  Obtain the simplified Boolean function for each output (using K-maps or Boolean algebra).
6.  Draw the logic diagram.


### ➕ Common Combinational Circuits

*   **Adders:** Perform binary addition.
    *   **Half-Adder:** Adds two bits, producing a sum and a carry-out.
    *   **Full-Adder:** Adds three bits (two input bits and a carry-in), producing a sum and a carry-out.
    *   **Binary Parallel Adder (Ripple Carry Adder):** Cascades full-adders to add multi-bit numbers.  Carries "ripple" through stages, leading to propagation delay.


✅ **Action Items:**

*   Review and practice applying De Morgan's Laws.
*   Practice simplifying Boolean expressions using K-maps and the Quine-McCluskey method.
*   Design a simple combinational circuit (e.g., a 2-bit comparator).
