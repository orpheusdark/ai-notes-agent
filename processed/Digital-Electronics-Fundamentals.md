## 🧠 Core Concepts of Digital Electronics 💡

### ⚡ Analog vs. Digital Systems 🤔

| Feature        | Analog Systems                       | Digital Systems                        |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Signal Type    | Continuous                           | Discrete (binary)                      |
| Accuracy       | Less (susceptible to noise)          | High (immune to noise due to voltage ranges) |
| Hardware       | Amplifiers, Oscillators              | Logic gates, Flip-flops                |
| Example        | Thermometer, Tape recorder           | Calculator, Digital watch              |

*   *Example*: A mercury thermometer is analog; a digital thermometer with an LCD is digital.
*   **Logic Levels**:
    *   Logic 0 (LOW): 0V to 0.8V
    *   Logic 1 (HIGH): 2V to 5V  These ranges provide noise immunity.


## 🔢 Number Systems and Arithmetic 🧮

### 🎯 Common Number Systems 🔢

| Number System | Base | Digits Used      | Example         |
|---------------|------|------------------|------------------|
| Decimal       | 10   | 0–9              | 348              |
| Binary        | 2    | 0, 1             | 1011 (decimal 11) |
| Octal         | 8    | 0–7              | 57 (decimal 47)   |
| Hexadecimal   | 16   | 0–9, A–F         | 2F (decimal 47)     |


### 🔁 Number System Conversions 🔄

#### 🔸 Decimal to Binary:

*   *Example*: Convert 19₁₀ to Binary:
    *   19 ÷ 2 = 9 R 1
    *   9 ÷ 2 = 4 R 1
    *   4 ÷ 2 = 2 R 0
    *   2 ÷ 2 = 1 R 0
    *   1 ÷ 2 = 0 R 1  Result: 19₁₀ = 10011₂

#### 🔸 Binary to Decimal:

*   *Example*: 1011₂ = (1 × 2³) + (0 × 2²) + (1 × 2¹) + (1 × 2⁰) = 11₁₀

#### 🔸 Binary to Octal:

*   Group bits in 3s from the right: 101101₂ = 000 101 101₂ = 55₈

#### 🔸 Binary to Hexadecimal:

*   Group bits in 4s from the right: 101101₂ = 0010 1101₂ = 2D₁₆


### ➕ Binary Arithmetic ➕

| Operation     | Rule                             |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| 0 + 0         | 0                                |
| 1 + 0 / 0 + 1 | 1                                |
| 1 + 1         | 10 (carry 1)                     |
| 1 + 1 + 1     | 11 (carry 1)                     |

*   *Example* (Binary Addition):
    ```
    1101
    +1011
    ----
    11000
    ```

### 🧮 Complements 🔄

*Used for subtraction by addition.*

#### 🔹 1’s Complement:

*   Flip all bits. *Example*: 1101 → 0010

#### 🔹 2’s Complement:

*   Add 1 to the 1’s complement. *Example*: 1101 → 0010 → 0011


### ➖ Signed Numbers 🫄

*   Sign-Magnitude:  1001 = -1
*   1’s Complement: Bit flipping for negative representation.
*   2’s Complement: Preferred method in computers for representing signed numbers.


### 🧾 Digital Codes 🗂️

| Code         | Type         | Usage/Feature                        |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| BCD          | Weighted     | Decimal to 4-bit binary              |
| Excess-3     | Non-weighted | Self-complementary (add 3 to BCD)    |
| Gray Code    | Non-weighted | Only one bit changes at a time      |
| ASCII        | Alphanumeric | 7-bit character code (A = 65)        |
| EBCDIC       | Alphanumeric | IBM-specific 8-bit code              |
| Hamming Code | ECC          | Error detection and correction       |

*   *Example (BCD)*: Decimal 7 = 0111; Decimal 13 = 0001 0011 (BCD representation)


## 🔍 Boolean Algebra 🧮

*A mathematical system for expressing and simplifying logic operations.*

### 🔧 Operators and Symbols 🛠️

| Operation | Symbol | Meaning                     |
|----------|--------|-----------------------------|
| NOT      | A̅      | Inverts input                |
| AND      | A·B     | True if A AND B are true     |
| OR       | A + B   | True if A OR B are true    |
