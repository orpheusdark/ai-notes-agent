## 🚧 Challenges Faced

Here’s the dirt from the trenches:

### 🏠 Finding a Free Host
- Most “free” platforms like Render and Fly.io had hidden limits or required cards.
- **PythonAnywhere** (with an open console) met the truly free, 24/7 requirement.

### 🔐 GitHub Auth Woes
- Faced `401: Bad credentials` errors.
- Fixed by generating a **GitHub Personal Access Token** with `repo` scope and properly configuring it in the script.

### 📉 API Model Deprecation
- Initially used `gemini-pro`, which led to `404` errors.
- Switched to `gemini-1.5-flash`, which is faster and more reliable.

### 🧩 Library Versioning
- Upgraded to the latest `python-telegram-bot` library.
- Refactored code using `Application.builder()` and `async` methods.
