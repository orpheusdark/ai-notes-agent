üñºÔ∏è Image Analysis

**üîç Detailed Description**

The image is a photograph of a document, which appears to be a syllabus for a Discrete Mathematics Mid-Semester Exam.  The document is printed on white paper and shows some minor creases and imperfections from handling. The text is clearly legible, and the layout is organized into sections with headings and bullet points.

**üîë Key Objects**

* **University Information:** The syllabus clearly identifies **Parul University**, **Faculty of Engineering and Technology**, and the specific branch as **CSE/IT**.
* **Course Information:** The subject is listed as **Discrete Mathematics**, with a corresponding subject code. The semester is identified as the **3rd semester**.
* **Syllabus Content:**  The syllabus is divided into three units:
    * **Unit 1:** Covers Sets, Relations, Functions, and Lattices. Key concepts include Cartesian products, equivalence relations, countable/uncountable sets, and Cantor's diagonal argument.
    * **Unit 2:** Focuses on Principles of Mathematical Induction, including the well-ordering principle, division algorithm, and fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Basic counting techniques are also mentioned.
    * **Unit 3:** Deals with Propositional Logic, including syntax, semantics, validity, and truth tables.  Proof techniques like forward proof, proof by contradiction, and contraposition are also part of the curriculum.
* **Instructor Information:** The syllabus lists four subject coordinators with their titles and departments: **Khushbu A. Patiyal, Dr. Suman Ahmed, Chirag Solanki, and Dr. Manoj Dubey**.
* **Submission Information:** The document notes who submitted the syllabus (**Khushbu A. Patiyal**) and to whom it was submitted (**Dr. Mrudul Jani**).

**üåç Context and Interpretation**

The image is a clear and concise syllabus for a Discrete Mathematics course at a university level. The detailed listing of topics suggests a rigorous academic approach to the subject.  The presence of multiple instructors indicates either a team-teaching approach or a division of teaching responsibilities within the course.  The handwriting at the bottom suggests manual signing and submission of the hardcopy.  The overall quality of the image is sufficient for clear reading and analysis.  The information provided is consistent with what one would expect from a university-level course syllabus.
