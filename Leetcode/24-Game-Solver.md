# 🧮 24 Game Solver: Key Takeaways


## 🧠 Core Concepts 💡

### Problem Statement 🤔

The goal is to determine if it's possible to arrange four cards (numbers 1-9) using +, -, *, /, and parentheses to obtain a result of 24.

*   **Input:** An integer array `cards` of length 4, where each element represents a card with a number between 1 and 9.
*   **Output:** `true` if a valid expression resulting in 24 exists; `false` otherwise.

### Constraints 🚧

*   **Real Division:** `/` represents real-number division (e.g., 4 / (1 - 2/3) = 12).
*   **Binary Operations:** Operators are applied between exactly two numbers; unary minus is not allowed.
*   **No Concatenation:** Numbers cannot be concatenated (e.g.,  `1` and `2` cannot form `12`).


## 🧮 Allowed Operations ➕➖✖️➗

*   Addition (`+`)
*   Subtraction (`-`)
*   Multiplication (`*`)
*   Division (`/`)
*   Parentheses (`(` and `)`) to control order of operations.


## ⚠️ Prohibited Operations 🚫

*   Unary minus (e.g., `-1 + 2 + 3`)
*   Number concatenation (e.g., creating `12` from `1` and `2`)

## 🧪 Example Cases 🧪

*   **Example 1:** `cards = [4, 1, 8, 7]`  ➡️ Output: `true`  (`(8 - 4) * (7 - 1) = 24`)
*   **Example 2:** `cards = [1, 2, 1, 2]`  ➡️ Output: `false` (No valid expression sums to 24)


## ✅ Action Items

*   Develop an algorithm to efficiently check all possible combinations of operations and parentheses to determine if a solution exists.  Consider backtracking or dynamic programming approaches.
*   Implement the algorithm in a chosen programming language (e.g., Python, Java, C++).
*   Write unit tests to verify the correctness of the algorithm for various input cases, including edge cases and examples provided.
