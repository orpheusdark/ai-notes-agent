> This document summarizes key takeaways from a series of questions covering various topics including the biofuel revolution in India, fundamental duties of Indian citizens, globalization, GDP calculations, rupee depreciation, and a family relationship puzzle.  It also includes solutions to several mathematical problems.

## üå± India's Biofuel Revolution  

*   **Core Concepts:**  India is experiencing a significant push towards biofuel production, primarily ethanol, to reduce reliance on crude oil imports and decrease emissions.
    *   *Positive Impacts:* Increased ethanol production from sugarcane, maize, and surplus rice; supports sustainability, self-reliance, and farmer income; exceeding 20% blending target.
    *   *Challenges:* Potential diversion of food crops; high engine compatibility costs; long-term sustainability concerns.
*   **Key Question:**  The passage best describes the biofuel revolution, highlighting both its potential and challenges (Option C).


## üìú Fundamental Duties of Indian Citizens 

*   **Core Concepts:**  Fundamental Duties were added to the Indian Constitution via the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976, inspired by the USSR's constitution. These duties emphasize citizen responsibility alongside rights.
*   **Key Duties:**
    *   Respect the Constitution and National Symbols
    *   Uphold Sovereignty and Integrity of India
    *   Promote Harmony and Protect Public Property & Environment
    *   Strive for Excellence in All Spheres of Life
*   **Key Question:** All of the listed options are Fundamental Duties (Option D).


## üåê Globalization: Opportunities and Criticisms

*   **Core Concepts:** Globalization, driven by liberalization and privatization, has interconnected global economies, cultures, and populations.  This has yielded both positive and negative consequences.
    *   *Positive Arguments:* Increased access to global markets and technology; opportunities for developing countries to become significant international players.
    *   *Criticisms:*  Globalization may be a strategy by developed countries to expand markets; widening economic disparities between nations and people.
*   **Key Questions:**
    *   Globalization is best described as the economic, socio-cultural, and technological integration of the world (Option D).
    *   Critics argue that globalization widens economic disparities (Assertion A is true), and this is because developed countries use it to expand their markets (Reason R is true and correctly explains A).
    *   The assertion that globalization results *only* in benefits of high technology and market expansion is false (A is false), and the reason that all countries experience equal benefits is also false (R is false).
    *   The policy measures linked to globalization are liberalization and privatization (Option B).


## üßÆ Mathematical Problems & Solutions

*   **Problem 1:** Two integers sum to 10, and their reciprocals sum to 5/12. The integers are 6 and 4.
*   **Problem 2:** A bike sold for ‚Çπ84,000 at a 12% profit. The cost price was ‚Çπ75,000 (Option A).
*   **Problem 3:** The number of four-digit numbers formable using digits 1-7 (repetition allowed) and divisible by 5 is 7 x 7 x 7 x 1 = 343 (Option C).
*   **Problem 4:** If 50% of a number is 200, then 25% of that number is 100.
*   **Problem 5:** A purse contains coins in the ratio 1:2:5. If the total number of coins is given (the exact number is missing from the original text), the total value can be calculated using this ratio and the value of each coin type.  (Missing Information Prevents Solution).
*   **Problem 6:**  In a row of 28 people, if Sunita is 6th from the left, there are 21 people after her (28 - 6 = 22, but this includes Sunita; therefore, 22 - 1 = 21).

## üìä Understanding GDP, GNP, and NNI

*   **Core Concepts:**
    *   **GDP (Gross Domestic Product):** The total monetary value of all final goods and services produced *within* a country's borders.
    *   **GNP (Gross National Product):** GDP + income earned by residents from abroad - income earned by foreigners in the country.
    *   **NNI (Net National Income):** GNP - depreciation.
*   **Key Questions:**
    *   GDP measures the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders (Option B).
    *   GNP is obtained from GDP by adding income from abroad and subtracting income earned by foreigners in the country (Option B).
    *   NNI signifies GNP minus depreciation (Option B).


## üí± Rupee Depreciation

*   **Core Concepts:** Rupee depreciation means a fall in its value against other currencies (mainly the US dollar). This is influenced by trade deficits, rising crude oil prices, capital outflows, and global monetary changes. While it can boost exports, it increases import costs and inflation.
*   **Key Questions:**
    *   Depreciation of the Indian rupee means a fall in its value against foreign currencies (Option B).
    *   If the rupee's value against the dollar decreased from 70 to 84, this represents rupee depreciation.
    *   Factors causing rupee depreciation are trade deficits, rising crude oil prices, and capital outflows (Option A).


## üèûÔ∏è Indian River Systems

*   **Core Concepts:** India's rivers are categorized into Himalayan and Peninsular systems. Himalayan rivers (Ganga, Indus, Brahmaputra) are perennial, fed by rain and snowmelt. Peninsular rivers (Godavari, Krishna) are rain-fed, shorter, and seasonal. Most flow eastward, but some (Narmada, Tapi) flow westward.
*   **Key Questions:**
    *   Himalayan rivers are differentiated from Peninsular rivers by being perennial and longer, while Peninsular rivers are seasonal and shorter (Option A).
    *   It can be inferred that some Indian rivers drain into the Arabian Sea (Option A).
    *   Peninsular rivers show seasonal variation in flow (Option B).


## üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Family Relationship Puzzle

*   **Relationships:**
    *   J is T's sister.
    *   T is married to D.
    *   D is the father of R.
    *   M is the son of H.
    *   T is H's mother-in-law.
    *   D has only one son (R) and no daughters.
    *   J is married to B.
    *   L is the daughter of B.
*   **Key Questions:**
    *   L is T's niece.
    *   M is D's grandson.
    *   J is R's aunt.


‚úÖ **Action Items:**

*   Obtain the missing total number of coins in Question 25 to solve the problem.
*   Review the provided information more thoroughly to ensure accuracy in interpretations.
