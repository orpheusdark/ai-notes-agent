## B.Tech CSE Unit-I Notes: Introduction to Algorithms & Programming Languages

**I. Algorithms:**

* **Definition:** A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem.  A set of rules/instructions to execute a task and achieve desired results.

* **Key Features:**
    * **Clear & Unambiguous:** Each step has only one interpretation.
    * **Well-Defined Inputs:** Clearly specified input requirements.
    * **Well-Defined Outputs:** Clearly specified expected outputs.
    * **Finiteness:**  Must terminate after a finite number of steps; no infinite loops.
    * **Feasible:**  Possible to execute with available resources.  No reliance on futuristic technology.
    * **Language Independent:** Can be implemented in any programming language.

* **Advantages:**
    * Easy to understand.
    * Step-wise problem-solving approach.
    * Easier to convert into a program.

* **Disadvantages:**
    * Time-consuming to write.
    * Branching and looping can be difficult to represent clearly.

* **Algorithm Design Prerequisites:**
    1. Problem to be solved.
    2. Problem constraints.
    3. Input requirements.
    4. Expected output.
    5. Solution within constraints.

* **Example: Algorithm to add 3 numbers:**
    1. START
    2. Declare integer variables: `num1`, `num2`, `num3`.
    3. Input `num1`, `num2`, `num3`.
    4. Declare integer variable `sum`.
    5. `sum = num1 + num2 + num3`
    6. Print `sum`
    7. END


**II. Flowcharts:**

* **Definition:** A graphical representation of an algorithm. Uses symbols to represent actions and their sequence.

* **Common Flowchart Symbols:**
    * **Rectangle:** Process (action)
    * **Oval:** Start/End
    * **Diamond:** Decision (conditional branching)
    * **Parallelogram:** Input/Output


**III. Algorithms vs. Flowcharts:**

| Feature       | Algorithm                               | Flowchart                                  |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Representation | Text-based, step-by-step instructions     | Graphical, using symbols                     |
| Understandability | Can be complex                           | Generally easier to understand                |
| Debugging      | Easier                                     | Harder                                       |
| Construction   | Difficult                                  | Simpler                                      |
| Rules          | Less formal                               | Follows standard symbol conventions           |
| Nature         | Pseudo-code for a program               | Graphical representation of program logic     |


**IV. Pseudocode:**

* **Definition:** An informal, artificial language used to design algorithms. Text-based, more detailed than an algorithm's plain description, but less formal than a programming language.  Uses indentation to show dependency between statements.

* **Pseudocode vs. Algorithm:** Pseudocode describes the program's flow; an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.  Pseudocode forms the basis for an algorithm, which in turn forms the basis for a program in a specific language.


**V. Programming Languages:**

* **Definition:** Languages used to write instructions for computers.

* **Types:**
    * **Low-level languages:** Directly interact with hardware (e.g., Assembly language).
    * **High-level languages:** More abstract and human-readable (e.g., C, C++, Java, Python).
