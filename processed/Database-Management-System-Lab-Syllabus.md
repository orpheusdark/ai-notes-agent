## 🧪 List of Practicals 

Each practical involves creating and querying databases using SQL.  Data types to be used include `varchar2(30)` for alphanumeric characters and special symbols, `number` for numbers, and `date` for dates.  Table and column names should match the provided specifications.

### 🖥️ Practical 1: Introduction to DBMS and Database Applications

* What is DBMS? Explain advantages of DBMS over FPS.
* List 15 applications of databases. Explain how databases can help manage 2 of these applications.
* Create databases for:
    * Student details using Excel.
    * Employee details using MS Access.
    * Facebook data using Excel.

### 🏗️ Practical 2: Table Creation and Data Insertion

* Create the following tables: `Employee` (with columns `Emp_name`, `Street`, `City`).


### 🔎 Practical 3 & 4: Simple SQL Queries (Retrieval)

These practicals involve a series of `SELECT` queries to retrieve data from various tables (e.g., `DEPOSIT`, `BORROW`, `CUSTOMERS`, `BRANCH`, `SAILORS`).  Queries include filtering using `WHERE` clause (e.g., `WHERE amount > 4000`).


### 🔍 Practical 5: Queries using the `LIKE` Operator

* Queries involving pattern matching using `LIKE` operator (e.g., names starting or ending with specific characters).

### 🧮 Practical 6: Aggregate Functions and DML

* Use of aggregate functions like `SUM`, `MAX`, `AVG`, `COUNT`.
* Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations like `UPDATE`.

### 🔗 Practical 7 & 8: Join Queries

* Complex queries using `JOIN` operations to combine data from multiple tables. These practicals cover various types of joins (implied, inner, outer) and conditions.

### 杂 Practical 9: Miscellaneous Queries

* A diverse set of queries combining multiple concepts learned in previous practicals.

### ⚙️ Practical 10: PL/SQL Blocks

* Writing PL/SQL blocks to perform tasks like adding numbers, calculating areas, finding maximums, generating Fibonacci series, and other basic programming tasks.


## 📝 Exam Requirements
