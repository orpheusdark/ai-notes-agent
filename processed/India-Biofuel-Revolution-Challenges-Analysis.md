**Question 1:**

* **Question:** Which of the following best describes the above passage?
* **Passage:**  A passage describing India's biofuel revolution, its successes (20% ethanol blending ahead of target), its benefits (reduced imports, emissions, support for farmers), and its challenges (food crop diversion, engine compatibility costs).

While private companies are involved (a), the passage doesn't solely concentrate on them.  (b) is incorrect because the passage emphasizes both advantages and disadvantages.

* **Explanation:** The passage mentions sustainability and self-reliance as benefits of the biofuel economy. Economic growth is also implicitly suggested through the improved farmer incomes and reduced import reliance.  However, the passage doesn't claim that biofuel is freely available; its production and distribution involve companies and government policies.

* **Correct Answer:** Both A and R are true, and R is the correct explanation of A.
* **Explanation:** The passage states that critics argue globalization widens economic disparities (A), and that developed countries use it to expand their markets (R).  R provides a reason for A; the critics' concern about disparity is directly linked to the perceived self-serving actions of developed nations.


**Question 6:**

* **Passage:** (Same as Question 4)

**Question 8:**

* **Question:** The sum of two integers is 10 and the sum of their reciprocals is 5/12. The integers are?
* **Answer:** 6, 4
* **Explanation:** Let the two integers be x and y.  We have the equations:
    * x + y = 10
    * 1/x + 1/y = 5/12
Solving these equations simultaneously (substituting y = 10 - x into the second equation and simplifying) will yield x = 6 and y = 4 (or vice versa).


**Question 9:**

* **Question:** A man sold his bike for Rs 84000, and made a profit of 12%. What was the cost price of the bike?
* **Answer:** A. 75000
* **Explanation:** Let the cost price be 'C'.  The selling price is 112% of the cost price (100% + 12% profit).  So, 1.12C = 84000. Solving for C gives C = 75000.


**Question 10:**

* **Question:** How many four-digit numbers can be formed with digits from 1 to 7 (repetition allowed), which are divisible by 5?
* **Answer:** A. 400
* **Explanation:** A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. Since we can only use digits 1-7, the last digit must be 5.  The first three digits can be any of the seven digits (1-7), with repetition allowed. Therefore, there are 7 * 7 * 7 * 1 = 343 such numbers.  The provided answer of 400 is incorrect based on the problem statement.

* **Question:** A purse contains 1, 2, and 5 coins in the ratio 5:3:2. If the total number of coins is 20, what is the total value of the coins?
* **Answer:** 198

Since there are a total of 10 parts for every 20 coins, each part represents 2 coins.  Therefore, there are 5*2 = 10 one-rupee coins (10 rupees), 3*2 = 6 two-rupee coins (12 rupees), and 2*2 = 4 five-rupee coins (20 rupees). The total value is 10 + 12 + 20 = 42 rupees.
